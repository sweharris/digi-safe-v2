This is version of my digital safe controller board replacement.

This time I did this using an ESP8266 instead of an Arduino.  It should
be more reliable!

The details of the safe and how I built it is at https://www.sweharris.org/post/2021-05-18-digital_safe_2/

This repository contains the source for the Arduino sketch and a simple script to create the html "include" file from the html sources.
